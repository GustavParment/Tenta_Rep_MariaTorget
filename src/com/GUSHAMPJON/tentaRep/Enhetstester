Why Unit testing?

   * Find eventual problems before publishing code
   * New functionality, same tests
   * Saves Time, Effort and energy
   * Writing Tests is efficient

How to work:
   * Annotations marks Unit Tests with Junit (@Test)
   * built in functions to assertIfTrue()
   * @Test() annotation (method level)
   * When running a test, check for MuMULTIPLE CONDITIONS:
     - Datatype
     - IF Null
     - True
     - SOUTS excluded from Main
     - Sequence of methods, right order?


Debugging VS Unit Testing?
   *** Debugging ***
   ---> Run the app
   ---> Breakpoints
   ---> Terminal and flow

   *** Unit Testing ***
   ---> Do not NEED to run ENTIRE app
   ---> Limit tests to certain methods
   ---> New functionality, quicker to debug

Conclusion: "With unit Tests, lets say you have 100 lines of new code
             Do we have to Run the entire app to see the new functionality?

             Answer is: No. It is unnecessary "
